# Traffic Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to analyze traffic data and predict future traffic patterns using machine learning techniques. The system uses historical traffic data, weather data, and other relevant factors to forecast traffic flow. The goal is to help optimize traffic management and reduce congestion.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and identifying patterns in the traffic data.
- **Modeling:** Training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future traffic trends.
- **Evaluation:** Using metrics like MAE, RMSE to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization:** Presenting results through charts and graphs.
